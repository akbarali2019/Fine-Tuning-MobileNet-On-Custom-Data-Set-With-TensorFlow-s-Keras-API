Looking pretty good! Just checking out the diagonal in blue that contains all the correctly predicted samples, we can get an idea that the model did pretty well. Each class had 5 samples, and we see a decent amount of 5s here.

Total, the model did not give incorrect predictions at all, which gives us an accuracy of 100% on the test set.
